                    My name is Emily, and I graduated from MIT with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (18) and Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making (6-4) and a humanities concentration in Leadership & Negotiation. Currently, I am pursuing a Masters of Engineering in AI at MIT.
                    <br /><br />
                    I call Bay Area, California and Cambridge, Massachusetts home, and my interests span product management to consulting and include mathematical modeling, technology policy, and software engineering.    
                    <br /><br />
                    Beyond the classroom, I was a member of the <a href="https://mitathletics.com/sports/womens-volleyball">MIT Women's Varsity Volleyball</a> team, the <a href="https://linktr.ee/ckmit">Baker Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.theta.mit.edu/">Îšappa Alpha Theta</a>, and <a href="https://linktr.ee/ckmit">Camp Kesem</a>.
